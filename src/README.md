# My Weather App

My Weather App is an app created using JavaScript and React for tracking weather data from around the world. 

Users need to simply click on the search navigation feature and type in a city, state, or zip code to access basic weather data accessed from an external API.

Users can save this data and add it to a watchlist that is accessed via the navigation bar. This data is persisted to a server and so will be saved for future use.

## Installation

Using node package manager, install and run the server using :
###`npm instal && npm start`

In a new terminal run the db.json server using the follow  command:
###`json-server --w db.json -p 4000`
